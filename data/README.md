## Benchmark Directory
This directory contains the curated benchmark used in experiments. Programs are stored in four folders:
- `tutorial_wp`
- `frama_c_problems`
- `lms_verify`
- `autospec_bench`

The `dataset_path` folder contains several `.txt` files that record the file paths of these benchmark programs, required as input for this framework.
