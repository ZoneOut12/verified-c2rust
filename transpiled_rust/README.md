## Transpiled Rust Code

The `transpiled_rust` directory contains the Rust versions of 160 migratable C programs used in our experiments, transpiled using the `Qwen3-235B-A22B` model. These Rust files are ready for immediate use.

Four subfolders correspond to those under the `data` directory, with the only difference being that dots (`.`) in file names are replaced with underscores (`_`).
